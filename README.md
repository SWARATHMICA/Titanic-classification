# Titanic-classification
This Python module demonstrates how to predict survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. It utilizes machine learning techniques such as feature scaling, text vectorization, and classification to build a predictive model based on the famous Titanic dataset.

# Features
# Feature Selection: 
Selects relevant features (pclass, sex, age, fare) from the Titanic dataset.
# Data Preprocessing:
Scales numeric features using StandardScaler and vectorizes textual data (name column) using TfidfVectorizer.
# Model Training: 
Trains a logistic regression model using the preprocessed data.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.
# Prediction: 
Includes functionality to predict survival for new instances using the trained model.
